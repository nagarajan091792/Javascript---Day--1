2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. An object is a primitive  data type.
2. An object can be created with figure brackets {…} 
   with an optional list of properties.
3. A property is a "key: value" pair, where a key is a string, 
   and value can be anything.
4. Objects can contain many values.

  an example of a JavaScript Object :
  
    let school = {
    name        : "Vivekananda School",
    location    : "Tamilnadu",
    established : 1997
    } ;  

Key - name,location,established

Values - "Vivekananda School","Tamilnadu",1997 
 
call in full object - console.log(school) = { name: 'Vivekananda School',
                                              location: 'Tamilnadu',
                                              established: '1997' } 

Call in name value- (school.name) or (school['name'])  = Vivekananda School.

changing value ---- school.name = 'Gov school' (changing school name)

new key and value adding ---- school.rank = 32; (add new propertie in rank : 32)
